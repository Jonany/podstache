# Podstache

A fun little app that helps you stache (ðŸ¥¸) away podcasts.


## Roadmap


### â¬œ Add feeds.

### â¬œ Remove feeds.

### â¬œ View feeds.

### â¬œ Archive shows

Keep episodes in the feed even after the upstream feed has removed or hidden them.


### â¬œ Download the podcasts on a set schedule

### â¬œ Generate RSS feeds


At the very least by copying the upstream feed and replacing the file locations with the local paths
