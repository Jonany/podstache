# Podstache ðŸ¥¸

1. Just a good podcast app (single platform, any platform, no backups).
   a. Pay for backups.
2. #1 plus multi-device sync/backup. Requires payment.

Okay. So to summarize, the use case,

There's the Single platform any platform use case where you just want a good podcast app that just works. And, You're either downloading. Or streaming. Just on that device. From the sources like, you know, your podcast feeds or whatever. Um, That's, that's the first use case.

The second use case, is that. I just want a good podcast player, but you want a good podcast player that syncs your listening history, your subscriptions, your playlists. I would say even like what you have downloaded on. Which, Device. Um, Maybe something like that.

The third use case. Is. Similar. But it's You want? Um, You want to be able to choose. The. Files that you Um, Like you want to be able to like customize the files and then On on one machine. Which would really just be a desktop, like, you don't have to customize them on a desktop. And then, be able to distribute those customized files. To another either another desktop or a mobile device. Um, Through the app. Um, It's like, In-House. Uh, on platform. First first party like kind of a thing. Um,

And so, and then there's there's sort of like The serving aspect of it, there's some They're sort of like I guess like if you want first party, Customization, and redistribution. That's one sort of scenario. And honestly might just use the same kind of

The same Tech. So it might not really be.

Well, I guess it would manage if you did first party, it would manage the The networking for you. So, instead of If you want, you can just have like one use case of the serve like, Uh, what did I call it custom? Customize and redistribute. One aspect of that.

Or one use case of that is just like You know, I have it on my computer White desktop computer. I have these feeds, I re-encode them as. Oggs. And then, I serve. I re redistribute them, that's so customizing. Transcoding them as ogs and then The redistribution is serving those files as

Rss feeds. So any like anybody who has Network access to that computer? Can then like pick up that RSS speed and

Use the The RSS bit, the consume the RSS. But then then it's like, okay, what if I'm off network and I want to be able to like connect to my My my customized files and then it's like, okay. Well, you know, you can either handle that yourself. Using something like tail scale or Um, If you're using.

If you're using our app on, Both devices. And you're a paying customer. Then you can just like, Connect. Automatically. And,

Yeah, you can connect automatically. And just You know, download whatever you want and it'll just be available. So what am I at? That's the third one, I think.

Yeah, that's the third one. I would say.

Well, it's like three. And 3B. I guess.

And, And then, I guess three C would be kind of like,

You are. Self-Hosting the application in like, In a container or something. And so that way it's always available and you can still use Either just the RSS feed and do your own. Networking as needed, or you could use our system, which would probably be some sort of Peer to peer.

Um,

Some kind of peer-to-peer data transfer. Scenario.

Oh yeah. I think that's all of them.

And I guess, Number one, where you're only using our app on one platform. And not serving. Contents over the network, a sort of like 1.1. Or 1A. Kind of a use case would be You are doubt like you're still used like using it on desktop or whatever and you're downloading it, and then you're transferring it.

You're using file system transfer to transfer it to another device that doesn't have access to the app. Um, So I think that's that's sort of like, what?

Uh, I don't know.

You three like, broad use cases. With.

A few. Sub points under some of them.
